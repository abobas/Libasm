# Libasm

## Project

This is a project for Codam (42 Network). <br>

The assignment consisted of reimplementing the following C functions in x64 assembly:
- `strlen`
- `strcpy`
- `strcmp`
- `write`
- `read`
- `strdup`

The bonus consisted of implementing the following 42 Network's C functions in x64 assembly:
- `ft_atoi_base`
- `ft_list_push_front`
- `ft_list_size`
- `ft_list_sort`
- `ft_list_remove_if`

This project is written in Intel syntax and written for a BSD based system (read / write system calls).

I finished the project on 24/4/2020 with a grade of 125%.
